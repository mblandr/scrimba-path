### Your challenge
- Change the base font-size for everything to .9rem
- Create a media query that targets a viewport of 600px and bigger
- Inside the media query, set the base font-size to 1.3125rem
- Declare something to prevent the images from overflowing at small screen sizes

### Tips
- We have to select the html element to change the “base” font-size
- For the images, we want to set a maximum width, which means if their parent is smaller than the image, the image will shrink with it
